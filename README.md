## How to test

You have two options to test this application.

The first is to install the Android SDK to get the android device emulator on the official website and later test this application.

The second, which I particulamente recommend is to install on your Android smartphone or Iphone, an application called Expo found on the PlayStore and AppleStore. I definitely recommend this 

After installing Expo on your smartphone, you should open the Expo app and click Scan QR Code, then allow Expo to have access to your camera, and when it opens, point the camera to the QR Code that appears on your computer screen if you have already cloned or downloaded the project and are running it.
